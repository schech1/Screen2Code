Privacy Policy for Screen2Code
Effective Date: 20.02.2025

Screen2Code (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you use our application, Screen2Code (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù).

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal data directly from users. The only data collected is the following:

Apple Standard Analytics: We may collect data via Apple‚Äôs standard analytics tools through App Store Connect for operational and performance monitoring. This data is anonymized and does not identify individual users.
Base64-Encoded Screenshot Data: The App allows you to upload a screenshot for the purpose of generating code. This image is converted to a base64-encoded string and sent to OpenAI‚Äôs API to generate code based on the screenshot.
We do not store, share, or process this data beyond its submission to OpenAI‚Äôs API for the purpose of generating code.

2. Use of Third-Party Services

We use OpenAI‚Äôs API to process screenshots and generate code. When you submit a screenshot to the App, it is transmitted to OpenAI‚Äôs servers, and the resulting code is sent back to the App. OpenAI‚Äôs use of your data is governed by their own privacy policy, which you can review on their website.

We do not control the data processing by OpenAI and are not responsible for how they handle your information.

3. Data Retention and Storage

We do not store any of the data you submit through the App. All screenshots are processed in real-time, and no personal information or image data is retained on our servers.

4. Security

We employ industry-standard security measures to protect any data submitted to the App, but it‚Äôs important to understand that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

5. User Rights

Since we do not collect, store, or process personal information beyond the temporary submission of your screenshots to OpenAI, there are no data access, correction, or deletion rights that apply.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version of this Privacy Policy, which will be accessible in the App and on our website.
